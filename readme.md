# üß± OOP Brick Breaker Game (Java)

This project is a classic Brick Breaker game developed using **Java** and **Swing**, designed to showcase mastery of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, including **Encapsulation**, **Abstraction**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Technical Highlights

* **Polymorphic Brick Hierarchy:** The game uses a single abstract superclass (`Brick.java`) to manage four distinct brick behaviors:
    * **`MultiHitBrick`:** Requires 3 hits, changes color (`Red` ‚Üí `Orange` ‚Üí `White`) with each impact.
    * **`PowerUpBrick`:** Requires 2 hits, and on breaking, grants the **Super-Ball** power-up.
    * **`SimpleBrick`:** Breaks on 1 hit.
    * **`UnbreakableBrick`:** Remains permanently on the map.
* **"Fired Up" Super-Ball Power-Up:** The `Ball` object enters a temporary super-state, allowing it to instantly destroy any brick it touches without bouncing back. The state ends when the ball hits the paddle again.
* **Tuned Difficulty:** Ball speed increases progressively only after every 4 paddle bounces, preventing unbalanced difficulty jumps.
* **OOP Architecture:** The game state and behavior of core components (`Ball`, `Paddle`, `MapGenerator`) are strictly separated into their own classes, demonstrating clean **Encapsulation** and **Composition**.
* **Time Tracking:** Includes a real-time game clock to measure player efficiency.
